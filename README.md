# Turbo Meme Generator Template Designer
Because it's such a pain to make a template in the traditional way, I decided to make an editor.

It's in HTML5 and JavaScript because I'm too ~~stupid~~ inexperienced with C++ or whatnot to make a proper program with a proper interface.

One upside of it being made on web is that [the designer is usable online!](todolol)
